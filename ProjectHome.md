project goal is easily show rss content in JSF pages. use RSS4JSF, you just need put the RSS4JSF.jar and the only need jar (rsslib4j-0.2.jar) in you WEB-INF/lib . and you can use the r4j tag to show rss content. please see the demo.

RSS4JSF's idea comes from FaceRSS(http://codegravity.com/index.php/facerss)

I need a RSS jsf tag . I search the web and find the FaceRss , but I find FaceRss's function is so simple. so i decide to develop a advanced tag. So the rss4jsf come out.


The newest release includes the ability to have full control over the HTML generated through facets; Facelets support; the ability to install to a Maven2 repository; and the ability to build the project with dependencies from the central Maven repository.


It is available with dependencies as a featured download on the right side of the page. Also see [Usage](Usage.md).
